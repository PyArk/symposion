- A 'paid Cart' is a Cart with a paid Invoice attached to it, where the Invoice has not been voided.
- An Item is 'reserved' if:
  - it belongs to an 
  - it belongs to a paid Cart
- An unpaid Cart is 'reserved' if 
 - CURRENT_TIME - "Time last updated" <= max(reservation duration of Products in Cart),
 - A Voucher was added and CURRENT_TIME - "Time last updated" < VOUCHER_RESERVATION_TIME (15 minutes?)
- A Cart can have any number of Items added to it, subject to limits.


## Entering Vouchers
- Vouchers are attached to Carts
- A user can enter codes for as many different Vouchers as they like.
- A Voucher is added to the Cart if the number of paid or reserved Carts containing the Voucher is less than the "total available" for the voucher.


## Displaying Products:

- If there is at least one EnablingCondition attached to the Product, display it only if at least one EnablingCondition is met
- If there are zero EnablingConditions attached to the Product, display it
- If the user has exceeded the "Limit per user" for the Product in their active and paid Carts, display it as "unavailable".
- If the Product belongs to an exhausted Ceiling, display it as "unavailable".

- If the Product is displayed and available, its price is the price for the Product, minus the greatest Discount available to this Cart and Product

- The product is displayed per the rendering characteristics of the Category it belongs to


## Displaying Categories

- If the Category contains only "unavailable" Products, mark it as "unavailable"
- If the Category contains no displayed Products, do not display the Category
- If the Category contains at least one EnablingCondition, display it only if at least one EnablingCondition is met
- If the Category contains no EnablingConditions, display it


## Exhausting Ceilings
- A ceiling is exhausted if:
 - Its start dateÂ has not yet been reached
 - Its end date has been exceeded
 - The sum of each total item 


## Adding Items to the Cart

- Only Products that are displayed and not marked as "unavailable" may be added to a cart (i.e. revalidate display properties)
