- A Cart can have any number of Items added to it, subject to limits.


## Entering Vouchers
- Vouchers are attached to Carts
- A user can enter codes for as many different Vouchers as they like.
- A Voucher is added to the Cart if the number of paid or reserved Carts containing the Voucher is less than the "total available" for the voucher.


## Displaying Products:

- If there is at least one EnablingCondition attached to the Product, display it only if at least one EnablingCondition is met
- If there are zero EnablingConditions attached to the Product, display it
- If the user has exceeded the "Limit per user" for the Product in their active and paid Carts, display it as "unavailable".
- If the Product belongs to an exhausted Ceiling, display it as "unavailable".

- If the Product is displayed and available, its price is the price for the Product, minus the greatest Discount available to this Cart and Product

- The product is displayed per the rendering characteristics of the Category it belongs to


## Displaying Categories

- If the Category contains no displayed Products, do not display the Category
- If the Category contains at least one EnablingCondition, display it only if at least one EnablingCondition is met
